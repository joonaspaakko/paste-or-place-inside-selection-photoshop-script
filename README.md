# Photoshop Script: Paste or Place Inside Selection.jsx

The scripts helps you paste or place images using fit and fill methods.

# Usage

You got 2 starting points...

1. If you have an active marquee selection in the document, the image is placed inside the selection.
2. Otherwise the image is placed in a clipping mask with the active layer
    - If you want to place inside an existing clipping mask, you can select any layer that is party of that clipping mask. The new image will be placed on top of that stack.




## Good to know...
- Tested in PS CC 2019
- You should definitely set a shortcut to launch this script or otherwise it'll be too difficult to use fequently.
- Numbers from 1 to 4 can be used as shortcuts in the dialog. 
    - I should probably renew the dialog once more. I still sometimes get confused which buttons are for fill and which are for fit.
- Also `Spacebar` triggers place and `Enter` triggers paste.
- The old name was "Place Inside Selection.jsx".
